# Debat-eth

Ethereum Platform enabled Version of Tabroom.com for Running Debate Tournaments. I'm not intended for this to ever replace Tabroom.com but at the moment I think of it as a veritable PoC  just to show off what the technology is capable of.

### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized platform used for the building of decentralized applications on the blockchain. You interact with it by sending ether (the cryptocurrency its built on) to various smart contracts. If you're not familiar with it I highly suggest some background reading. When the project is done, you shouldn't need to know how it works.

### What Does it do?
When the project is finished the idea is to be able to mimic the tournament functions of a tab director and debate competitor.

As of right now I am working on the initial contracts. If you're interested in helping with them or the web interface feel free to contact me at jhweintraub@gmail.com 

### Do I get a trophy if I win?

Yes! Debat-eth supports Custom ERC721-Enabled Trophy Tokens. What is that? Imagine a digitized Trophy completely unique and personalized and sent to the address you register for the tournament with. It's sent automatically at the end of the tournament, designed by the Tournament Director, and tradeable to other wallets. Want to have a personal wallet where your team stores all it's tokens for the world to see? You can do that!

### Why should I use it over Tabroom.com

You shouldn't, at least not at the moment. This project was meant to be more of a PoC to show that blockchain enabled Dapps are capable of doing anything a regular web-app can do.

Pay your entry fee directly in Cryptocurrency - Default is ether but someday I would like for the director to be able to accept any ERC-20 Token at their discretion, especially so that it could someday support stablecoins like Tether, Dai, and USDC.

Committee of Tab Directors - When creating a tournament the Director will have to specify two validators to oversee the tournament. The tab director can't withdraw the entry fees paid to the tournament contract until they have both signed off on it at the end of the tournament.
