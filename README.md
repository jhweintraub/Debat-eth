# Debat-eth

Ethereum Platform enabled Version of Tabroom.com for Running Debate Tournaments. I'm not intended for this to ever replace Tabroom.com but at the moment I think of it as a veritable PoC  just to show off what the technology is capable of.

### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized platform used for the building of decentralized applications on the blockchain. You interact with it by sending ether (the cryptocurrency its built on) to various smart contracts. If you're not familiar with it I highly suggest some background reading. When the project is done, you shouldn't need to know how it works.

### What Does it do?
When the project is finished the idea is to be able to mimic the tournament functions of a tab director and debate competitor.

As of right now I am working on the initial contracts. If you're interested in helping with them or the web interface feel free to contact me at jhweintraub@gmail.com
